# OCI Learning Path — Foundations

This repository documents my journey toward mastering Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, starting with the core foundational concepts required for certification and real-world cloud architecture work.

The focus at this stage is building a strong understanding of:

- OCI networking (VCN, subnets, gateways, routing)
- Identity & Access Management (IAM)
- Compute and storage fundamentals
- Core architectural patterns that everything else in OCI builds on

As I progress, this repository will grow to include hands-on labs, architect-level designs, Kubernetes (OKE) deployments, DevOps pipelines, and migration frameworks. For now, the emphasis is on establishing a clean, solid foundation.

## 🧱 Current Focus: Foundations Associate Certification

### Goals

- Understand the core OCI concepts deeply and practically
- Build structured notes on networking, IAM, and storage
- Prepare efficiently for the OCI Foundations Associate exam
- Create a strong base for Architect Associate and DevOps specialization

## 🚀 Why This Repo Exists

To build a **public, transparent, and professional record** of my OCI cloud journey.
This isn't a notebook — it's the early foundation of a consulting portfolio.

More sections will be added as I move into:

- Architect Associate
- DevOps Professional
- OKE Kubernetes
- Cloud migrations
- Cost optimization frameworks

But for now:
> The goal is simple — master the fundamentals and document them clearly.
