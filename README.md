# OCI Learning Path — Foundations

This repository documents my journey toward mastering Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, starting with the core foundational concepts required for certification and real-world cloud architecture work.

At this stage, the focus is on building a strong and accurate understanding of:

- OCI networking (VCN, subnets, gateways, routing)
- Identity & Access Management (IAM)
- Compute and storage fundamentals
- Core architectural patterns that everything else in OCI builds on

As this work progresses, the repository will expand to include hands-on labs, architect-level designs, Kubernetes (OKE) deployments, DevOps pipelines, and cloud migration frameworks.

For now, the emphasis is on establishing a clean, solid foundation.

## 🧱 Current Focus: Foundations Associate Certification

### Goals

- Develop a practical understanding of core OCI services
- Build structured, concise documentation for networking, IAM, compute, and storage
- Prepare efficiently for the OCI Foundations Associate exam
- Establish a strong base for Architect Associate and DevOps specialization

## 🚀 Why This Repository Exists

To maintain a **public, transparent, and professional record** of my OCI learning and specialization path.

This is not a personal notebook.
It is the foundation of a **cloud consulting portfolio**, designed to evolve alongside certifications and hands-on implementation.

Planned future sections include:

- OCI Architect Associate
- OCI DevOps Professional
- Oracle Kubernetes Engine (OKE)
- Cloud migrations
- Cost optimization frameworks

## 🎓 Certifications

- **OCI Foundations Associate (1Z0-1085-25)** — Passed with **98%**
